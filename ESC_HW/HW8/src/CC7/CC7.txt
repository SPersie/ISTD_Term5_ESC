1. The first method I use is AtomicInteger. Since increamentAndGet() method is CAS-based, the counter by using AtomicInteger is CAS-based counter. Following is the result:
number of threads: 32	Total Time: 20503361
number of threads: 42	Total Time: 17841266
number of threads: 52	Total Time: 12896120
number of threads: 62	Total Time: 18008926
number of threads: 72	Total Time: 20645971
number of threads: 82	Total Time: 22855866
number of threads: 92	Total Time: 25644501

2. The second method is a lock-based counter. I use increment() to increase the counter value. And following is the result.
number of threads: 32	Total Time: 56568653
number of threads: 42	Total Time: 58785315
number of threads: 52	Total Time: 32592294
number of threads: 62	Total Time: 39357826
number of threads: 72	Total Time: 45483885
number of threads: 82	Total Time: 51572057
number of threads: 92	Total Time: 56234085

3. Clearly, CAS-based counter took much less time than lock-based counter.
