1. Thread =1000: single thread: 9564; 100 threads: 549
2. Thread =100: single thread: 223; 100 threads: 213
3. Thread =10: single thread: 64; 100 threads: 39

The same as the first one. When the number of threads reaches a certain number, the performance of multi threads
 will be much better than single thread. Otherwise, single thread has better performance than multi threads.
 The performance of fixed thread pool is always better than un-fixed threads.
